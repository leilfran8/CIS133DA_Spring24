        <h2>They Know How to Handle Dogs</h2>
        <p>
            Dogs who are old or become anxious or aggressive when you try to groom them must be handled gently and confidently, and some may need to be muzzled while being groomed – something a groomer can do. If you have a condition such as back pain or arthritis, professional grooming can help by preventing you from having to do excessive lifting and handling of your dog.

            Professional groomers have all the right tools to get your dog looking his best, from different kinds of clippers and rounded scissors to an adjustable grooming table. They’re equipped with nontoxic, gentle shampoos for dogs with skin allergies or irritations, or those with fleas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many groomers also know how to groom for breed show cuts, which requires precise attention to detail and knowledge of the specific breed requirements. Different coats require different brushes – and groomers have them. The more dead hair they remove from your dog, the less you’ll find on your living room rug.
